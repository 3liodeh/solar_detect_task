The current dataset was split with a ratio of 0.8 for training and 0.2 for validation. The reason behind this specific split is the scarcity of the available data, even after applying the "tiles" technique. Consequently, a separate test dataset was not allocated, and the validation set will be relied upon for evaluating the model's performance. The validation images are ones that the model has never seen before, which ensures a reliable assessment.A strict check was performed to prevent Data Leakage between the training and validation sets, further enhancing the trustworthiness of the evaluation results. These procedures, starting from data splitting and relying on validation as a substitute for testing, are all an attempt to compensate for the limited original data. You can review the data on which the processing and augmentation techniques were applied in the dedicated "augmentation" folder.
