I chose YOLOv11s because it offers the best balance between speed, lightweight design, and accuracy compared to other versions. The "s" version is very compact, which means it runs smoothly even on devices with limited resources, while still giving excellent detection performance. On top of that, it has very low inference time, making it great for real-time applications. Training it is also straightforward it doesn’t need much memory and can reach stable performance in fewer epochs, even on modest hardware.

In terms of results, YOLOv11s performed really well: mAP was over 98%, Precision was nearly perfect at 1.00, and Recall was around 95.8%, so it successfully detects almost all target objects. The loss curves were smooth, and the validation metrics stayed close to the training metrics, which shows the model trained reliably without overfitting. Overall, these results make YOLOv11s a practical and trustworthy choice.
